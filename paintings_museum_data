--Queried with: PosgreSQL 12

-- 1) Fetch all the paintings which are not displayed on any museums?

SELECT * FROM work
	WHERE museum_id IS NULL;

-- 2) Are there museuems without any paintings?

SELECT * FROM museum m
	LEFT JOIN work w ON w.museum_id = m.museum_id
		WHERE w.museum_id IS NULL;

select * from museum m
	where not exists (select 1 from work w
					 where w.museum_id=m.museum_id)
					 

-- 3) How many paintings have an asking price of more than their regular price? 

SELECT *
	FROM product_size
		WHERE sale_price > regular_price;

-- 4) Identify the paintings whose asking price is less than 50% of its regular price

SELECT *
	FROM product_size
		WHERE sale_price < (regular_price * 0.5);

-- 5) Which canva size costs the most?

SELECT * FROM canvas_size c
	JOIN product_size p on c.size_id::text=p.size_id
		ORDER BY p.sale_price DESC;

-- 6) Delete duplicate records from work, product_size and image_link tables
DELETE FROM work
	WHERE ctid NOT IN (SELECT min(ctid)
						  FROM work
						  GROUP BY work_id);
DELETE FROM product_size
	WHERE ctid NOT IN (SELECT min(ctid)
						  FROM product_size
						  GROUP BY work_id);

DELETE FROM image_link
	WHERE ctid NOT IN (SELECT min(ctid)
					  FROM image_link
					  GROUP BY work_id);
					  
-- 7) Identify the museums with invalid city information in the given dataset

SELECT * FROM museum
	WHERE city ~ '[0-9]';

-- 7) Fetch the top 10 most common subjects among works
		
SELECT * FROM (
		SELECT subject, COUNT(1) AS count,
		RANK() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(1) desc) AS ranking
		FROM subject
		GROUP BY subject) AS ranked
		WHERE ranking <= 10;
		
		
-- 8) Identify the museums which are open on both Sunday and Monday. Display museum name, city.

SELECT * FROM museum_hours mh1
	WHERE day = 'Sunday'
		AND EXISTS (SELECT 1 from museum_hours mh2
		   	WHERE mh2.museum_id = mh1.museum_id
		   	AND mh2.day = 'Monday')
			

-- 9) How many museums are open every single day?

SELECT museum_id, count(1)
		FROM museum_hours
			GROUP BY museum_id
				HAVING count(1) = 7;
		   
-- 10) Which are the top 5 most popular museum? (Popularity is defined based on most no of paintings in a museum)

SELECT * FROM (SELECT museum_id, COUNT(1), 
				RANK() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(1) DESC) AS rank
				FROM work
				GROUP BY museum_id) as popular_museums
				WHERE museum_id IS NOT NULL AND rank <= 6;

-- 11) Who are the top 5 most popular artist? (Popularity is defined based on most no of paintings done by an artist)		

SELECT * FROM
			(SELECT a.full_name, w.artist_id, COUNT(1),
	 		RANK() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(1) DESC) AS ranking
			FROM work w
			JOIN artist a ON a.artist_id = w.artist_id
			GROUP BY a.full_name, w.artist_id) AS subquery
		WHERE ranking <= 5;

-- 12) Display the 3 least popular canva sizes

SELECT * FROM
		(SELECT c.size_id, c.label, 
		COUNT(1), DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(1) ASC) AS ranking
		FROM work w
		JOIN product_size p ON p.work_id = w.work_id
		JOIN canvas_size c ON c.size_id::text= p.size_id
		GROUP BY c.size_id, c.label) subquery
	WHERE ranking <= 3;
